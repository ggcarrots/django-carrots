Code Carrots Manual
===================

This is a manual to learn Python. Even if you cannot program yet, you should be able to create your own applications by following the manual and doing all the exercises.

The manual is a part of the Code Carrots workshop organized by Geek Girls Carrots. You can use it to organize your own workshops or for self-study.
If you decide to use the manual, we would be grateful if you contact us (however it is optional).
